This is my second attempt of services written for the charybdis linking protocol. I realized a couple nights ago that what I was doing was an unorganized mess, so I started over. There are now 10 main files referring to each other. I plan to use DBD::CSV backend as I did in my former package, but that depends on whether or not I find something better. These services will also support ShadowIRCd. As of right now, there are no differences; feel free to link to either shadowircd or charybdis. :P It's August 11th 2010, and I have completed the _main_ handlers. Services handle EUID (support for euid is required at this time), SJOIN, JOIN, PART, QUIT, MODE, and PRIVMSG commands. I am yet to add a handler for channel modes and BMASK (will be needed when checking for bans, exceptions, and when using mlock). I have completed a few OperServ commands, and POPM is pretty much done. POPM is a simple open proxy monitor that checks all users upon connection and kills them if their IP is listed in one of the listings specified in the configuration. I'm sure there are a ton of bugs that I am yet to notice, but this is my first commit and I just started last night. Requirements: Digest::SHA1 (other encryption options planned),	DBI/DBD::CSV, IO::Socket, and their dependences. The configuration file is just a package... and a huge hash ref and 2 subroutines to fetch it. Pointless dependencies for a config file are pointless. If you have any questions/complaints, connect to my development network (69.164.222.215), or feel free to connect to irc.technoirc.net and join #cooper. I can also be found on ConnectTek and ZeroNET.
PS: I probably added a few debug prints that I forgot to remove. Feel free to notify me if you find one.

mandatory todo list for my reference:
handle UID (obviously) and ENCAP
parse channel modes and BMASK
add support for CHGHOST to reset users->{$uid}->{mask}
